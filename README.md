# Description

Restaurant is a Spring Boot based RESTful API that allows restaurant customers to make orders and the restaurant to manage orders and update their menu. It provides a simple and easy to use interface for both customers and the restaurant staff.

# Technologies used

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 2.5.6
- JPA
- Hibernate
- Spring Security

# Motivation

I've made this app to get to know Spring framework and how to write APIs. My use case comes from my grandmother's restaurant where she receives a lot of catering orders from companies.

# Features

- Customers can place orders through the API
- Restaurants can manage orders and update their menu
- Secure authentication and authorization using Spring Security
- Persistence of data using JPA and Hibernate

# Getting Started

Clone the repository and build the project using maven.
Run the Spring Boot Application.
Use a tool such as Postman to interact with the API and test the endpoints.
Endpoints for customers and restaurants are secured, but you can use following credentials to test the app:
client - login: client password: client
admin - login: admin password: admin

# Future improvements

Adding more functionalities for customers, such as tracking orders, rate and review the restaurant
