# Restaurant
It's a RESTful API, which allows clients to make orders from a restaurant and owner to edit restaurant's menu.

# General info
I've made this app to get to know Spring framework and how to write APIs. My use case comes from my grandmother's restaurant where she receives a lot of catering orders from companies.
